# Square Head Exercise

This file is just an exercise.

Thanks to this exercise I managed to practice my skills and exercise **CSS**:

- css selectors and pseudo elements
- z-index
- gradients and color spaces
- flex-box
- units
- transformations

Additionally I took advantage of the opportunity to use **CSS variables**.
